# Apps

This organization is focused on build a set of open source apps that could replace base services but focusing on freedom and privacy. Users have control of their data and people can learn how all of the things work.

# Drivers

The following are the drivers for this project.

## Knowledge should be open and free

People should have access to knowledge, the most advanced and recent knowledge available. Doesn't matter if they have money to pay for it, where they come from or any other attribute.

Knowledge should also be available in a form that people could monetize from it, by teaching or using it to learn how to build things on their own. Things that they can sell, or use to produce other things.

## Software is an enabler

Software changed the world. And it keeps changing it every single day. People should have access to high quality, high performing software that enables and aid them to live a better life. All of that without having to think about privacy and having their data violated by big corporation deals.

Developers (and all builders) shouldn't feel the pressure that they need to make software profitable to help people live a better life. They shouldn't feel like they can't build something to help their communities because it will cost too much money to stand the infrastructure or to keep the project running.

# How should it be?

Just like GitHub created a place where people can collaborate, read and write code in the open, we need a place where people can build and see how real world, global scale, secure applications are built and maintained.
