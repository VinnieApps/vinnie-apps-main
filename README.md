# Apps

This organization is focused on build a set of open source apps that could replace base services but focusing on freedom and privacy. Users have control of their data and people can learn how all the things work.

# Drivers

The following are the drivers for this organization and its projects.

## Knowledge should be open and free

People should have access to knowledge, the most advanced and recent knowledge available. Doesn't matter if they have money to pay for it, where they come from or any other attribute.

Knowledge should also be available in a form that people could monetize from it, by teaching or using it to learn how to build things on their own. Things that they can sell, or use to produce other things.

## Software is an enabler

Software changed the world. And it keeps changing it every single day. People should have access to high quality, high performing software that enables and aid them to live a better life. All of that without having to think about privacy and having their data violated by big corporation deals.

Developers (and all builders) shouldn't feel the pressure that they need to make software profitable to help people live a better life. They shouldn't feel like they can't build something to help their communities because it will cost too much money to stand the infrastructure or to keep the project running.

# How should it be?

Just like GitHub created a place where people can collaborate, read and write code in the open, we need a place where people can build and see how real world, global scale, secure applications are built and maintained.

# Goals

The following are the goals for this organization and its projects.

## Education

Build and collect a set of resources that can be used to teach people what software is and the many facets of it. These resources can be used by individuals to train themselves to become software engineers, product managers, tech writers, reliability engineers, etc.

These resources will have many different formats: courses, books, docmentation, data dashboards, code, etc. Each one of them can be used to learn a small piece of the giant, and always growing, realm of building software.

## Enable

Software can help people do things in a more efficient way. But most of the software that exist today is expensive because it has to pay for infrastructure and big profits.

This organization and its projects aim to create software that lives on infrastructure that is paid for from other means (e.g.: donations), written by the open source community and maintained by volunteers that want to learn and make the world a better place.

Because of that it's free!

Will it always be free? I really hope so, but if any project has demand that is too high and becomes too big to be maintained by donations, a very low cost could be charged. Enough to sustain the growth, maintain the infrastructure and possibly pay for the volunteer work. Demand means it is important, it means it is adding value to society. It also means that it needs to continue its journey and the extra money could help.
