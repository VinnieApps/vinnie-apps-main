# Apps

**TODO** Add basic blob about what this project is.

# Drivers

The following are the drivers for this project.

## Knowledge should be open and free

People should have access to knowledge, the most advanced and recent knowledge available. Doesn't matter if they have money to pay for it, where they come from or any other attribute.

## Software is an enabler

Software changed the world. And it keeps changing it every single day. People should have access to high quality, high performing software that enables and aid them to live a better life.

Developers (and all builders) shouldn't feel the pressure that everything they build must become a product and must make money. They shouldn't feel like they can't build something to help their communities because it will cost too much money to stand the infrastructure or to keep the project running.

# How should it be?
